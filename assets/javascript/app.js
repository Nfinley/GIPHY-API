// Author: Nigel Finley. August 2016. UT Bootcamp GIPHY API Assisgnment

// Instructions

// Before you can make any part of our site work, you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called topics.

// We chose animals for our theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.
// Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

// Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.
// When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

// When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

// Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

// This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
// Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
// Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.

// Rejoice! You just made something really cool.


// Variables
giphyObj: {
	topics: ["Coldplay", "The Beatles", "Beyonce", "Miley Cyrus", "Kim Kardashian", "Angelina Jolie", "Justin Bieber", "Taylor Swift", "Drake", "Brad Pitt", "George Clooney", "Mariah Carey", "Jennifer Aniston", "Power Rangers" ]







	// Functions
	buildButtons: function(){ 

		// Deletes the movies prior to adding new movies (this is necessary otherwise you will have repeat buttons)
		$('#buttonsView').empty();

		// Loops through the array of movies
		for (var i = 0; i < topics.length; i++){

			// Then dynamicaly generates buttons for each movie in the array

			// Note the jQUery syntax here... 
		    var a = $('<button>') // This code $('<button>') is all jQuery needs to create the beginning and end tag. (<button></button>)
		    a.addClass('movie'); // Added a class 
		    a.attr('data-name', movies[i]); // Added a data-attribute
		    a.text(movies[i]); // Provided the initial button text
		    $('#buttonsView').append(a); // Added the button to the HTML
		}
	}
